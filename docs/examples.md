# Examples

We'll add more examples, but the best places to look for now are:
* [The blog post that introduces data diffing](https://blog.marcua.net/2022/02/20/data-diffs-algorithms-for-explaining-what-changed-in-a-dataset.html), and
* [A Jupyter Notebook showing an end-to-end example](https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb).
