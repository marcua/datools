# History

## 0.1.4 (2022-02-27)
* Python 3.10 support.
* Updated test suite to run tests against multiple databases, in particular expanding from SQLite only to DuckDB and SQLite.
* As a result of the last bullet, ensured code runs against DuckDB in addition to SQLite.
* First stab at documentation (https://datools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## 0.1.3 (2021-12-31)
* Introduced mypy to linting and CI to ensure code that makes it to `main` has proper types.
* Created first working example of [DIFF working on a real-world dataset as a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb). This example partially replicates the Scorpion paper when only moteid/sensorids are considered.
* Separated the `on_columns` argument of `diff` into `on_column_values` (columns for which you want to generate equality predicates as explanations) and and `on_column_ranges` (columns for which you want to generate range predicates as explanations after bucketing the ranges into 15 equi-sized buckets).

## 0.1.2 (2021-11-07)
* First release of DIFF algorithm implementation.

## 0.1.0 (2021-05-09)
* First release on PyPI.
